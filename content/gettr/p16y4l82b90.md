【🆘🇺🇦🆘Report from NFSC's Ukraine Rescue by King】
When the days that the young Belgian is volunteering in the Medyka refugee camp,  he deeply felt that every volunteer put giving more help to Ukrainian refugees on the first place, while they neglect their own healthy and financial. This selfless and altruistic spirit moved him. At the same time, he believes that these volunteers also need financial or psychological help after completing their rescue work in Ukraine.

【🆘🇺🇦🆘来自乌克兰救援前线精糧的报道】
这位年轻的比利时义工在梅迪卡参与救援的日子里，深深感受到每一位义工都把为乌克兰难民提供更多的帮助放在首位，而忽略了对自己身体和经济方面的关心，这种忘我利他的精神让他感动。同时，他认为这些义工在完成在乌克兰的救援工作后，也需要经济或心理上的帮助。
