A French volunteer has been to China 12 times and he loves China very much. Nicole told him that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) created many disasters for people both inside China and worldwide, including this pandemic, which is caused by the CCP virus, (should) not (be called) the Chinese virus. He blesses all the people from the New Federal State of China (NFSC) and supports us to take down the CCP.

一位来自法国的志愿者说他去过中国12次，而且他非常喜爱中国。妮可告诉他中国共产党不仅给中共国内的人民制造灾难，而且给全世界的人制造灾难，包括这次疫情，是由中共病毒引起的，而不（应该）是（被称为）中国人病毒。他祝福所有新中国联邦人，并且支持我们推翻中共。
