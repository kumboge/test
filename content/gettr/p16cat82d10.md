【419 5th Anniversary】 4/19/2022 If the CCP invades Taiwan, the US and Japan will have no choice but to go to war provided that Taiwan resists the CCP's attack. If Taiwan does not fight back, the US, Japan, and other allied forces will wait until Taiwan is almost finished before joining the war to annihilate the CCP's troops. Xi definitely has the ball to use strategic nuclear weapons against Taiwan. Xi believes that it will be necessary to make it impossible for anyone to take Taiwan if he can't take it.<br/><br/>【419五周年】4/19/2022 如果中共打台湾，美日将别无选择地参战，前提是台湾要反抗中共进攻；若台湾不反抗，美日等盟军则会等台湾快完蛋的时候参战并灭掉共军；习绝对敢对台湾使用战略核武器，习觉得如果他得不到台湾，那就让谁都得不到！<br/>
